# Retail Demand Forecasting: Machine Learning vs Time Series Models

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive comparative study of traditional time series forecasting and machine learning models for retail demand forecasting using Walmart sales data.

The aim was to evaluate predictive accuracy, interpretability and business value of different forecasting approaches to support data-driven retail decision-making.

## Business Problem
Retailers rely on accurate demand forecasts to manage:
- Inventory planning
- Pricing strategies
- Promotion planning
- Supply chain operations

Inaccurate forecasts lead to overstocking, stockouts and revenue loss.

This project develops predictive models to improve forecast accuracy and support strategic retail decisions.
